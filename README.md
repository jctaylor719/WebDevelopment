# Web Development
All projects centered around front-end and back-end development.

I've categorized each project by the demonstrated skills.

## HTML and CSS
+ **All About the Fennec Fox**
  + A mock website detailing interesting facts about the fennec fox. 

## JavaScript and jQuery
+ **Art Commission Form**
  + Utilizes AJAX to create an accordion-style form with lots of error handling.

## PHP, MySQL
+ **Hotel Reservation System**
  + Uses phpMyAdmin-- an open source administration tool in order to store data collected on a mock hotel website.
  + Includes different functions for admins versus users
