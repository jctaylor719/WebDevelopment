## Showcased Skills

This website was my first (HTML-related) final project. In this project, I:

+ Imported fonts
+ Created a simple form
+ Worked with fundamental HTML tags, such as:
  + Ordered/Unordered lists
  + Images and image maps
  + Blockquotes
  + Header/Footer
  + Tables

## Fun Facts

+ The 'Cladogram Table' found under the 'Taxonomy' page was actually made using the table tag! I thought it would be a fun challenge, although it certainly is not efficient or dynamic.
+ Fennecs are really cute!
